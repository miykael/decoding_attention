### Title:
**Understanding Vision Transformers: From Image Patches to Cross-Attention**

### Content Outline

1. **Introduction & Dataset Overview:**
   - Brief recap of attention mechanisms from previous posts.
   - **Dataset Description:**
     - Explain our synthetic 2D shapes dataset (128x128 RGB images).
     - Detail the four shape types: filled circles, hollow circles, filled rectangles, hollow rectangles.
     - Describe the color averaging rules and special filtering for filled circles.
   *Figure:* Side-by-side comparison of:
     - Input image (multiple colored shapes)
     - Target image (shapes with group-average colors)
     - Example of filled circle filtering based on red channel dominance

2. **Tokenization and Positional Encoding for Vision:**
   - Explain the process of splitting images into patches (16×16).
   - Show how patches are flattened into tokens.
   - Discuss positional encoding options:
     - Sinusoidal encoding
     - Rotary positional encoding (RoPE)
     - Learnable position embeddings
   *Figure:* Detailed diagram showing:
     - Original image → Grid of patches
     - Single patch being flattened
     - Addition of positional encoding
     - Final embedded representation

3. **Cross-Attention in Vision Transformers:**
   - Explain how cross-attention differs from self-attention
   - Show how the decoder queries attend to encoder outputs
   - Demonstrate RGB channel-specific attention patterns
   *Figures:*
     - Block diagram of encoder-decoder architecture
     - Visualization of cross-attention mechanism
     - Channel-specific attention patterns for filled circles

4. **Attention Visualizations:**
   - Compare different attention patterns:
     - Self-attention in encoder
     - Cross-attention between encoder and decoder
     - Channel-specific attention for color filtering
   *Figures:*
     - Side-by-side attention matrix comparisons
     - Heatmaps showing which patches attend to which
     - RGB channel attention visualization

5. **Implementation Focus:**
   - Concentrate on encoder-decoder transformer implementation
   - Show key code snippets for:
     - Image patch embedding
     - Cross-attention mechanism
     - Color-based filtering logic
   *Note:* Brief mention of encoder-only/decoder-only variants without implementation details

6. **Experimental Results:**
   - Show example predictions
   - Visualize attention patterns
   - Demonstrate color filtering effects
   *Figures:*
     - Input → Prediction → Target comparisons
     - Attention visualization for specific examples
     - Color filter activation maps

7. **Discussion & Future Directions:**
   - Summarize key insights about cross-attention
   - Discuss potential extensions:
     - Different patch sizes
     - Alternative positional encodings
     - Efficient attention variants
   - Preview potential future topics:
     - Deeper dive into cross-attention
     - Efficient transformer variants
     - Advanced architecture comparisons

### Key Focus Points:
- Keep explanations intuitive and visual
